Mysts of Viamel is a text based RPG adventure following the main character as they are transported between different realms via the magical mist that connects the worlds (i.e. The Mysts of Viamel). Our team chose to work on this project because it allows us to play around with a lot of different features (i.e. character creation, money tracker, image production, etc). Through the thought process of creating the final draft of our idea we put together all three of our best ideas that we came up with alone; financial tracker, adventure game, and DnD character sheet manager. 

This game is supposed to act as a “gateway” RPG: intriguing to players but simple enough so those without lots of gaming experience can enjoy the game without being frustrated. The player will be able to create a simple character with a race and class, and then that character will travel randomly from realm to realm, each of which has a unique encounter. The user will be able to use race and class feats to solve the puzzle or challenge in the realm, and then proceed to the next one. The software will keep track of the money, items, health, abilities, and experiences the player gains or loses as they progress in the game. Sprinkled in will be interesting lore about the world/s and funny moments that will inspire the user to continue playing and exploring the different worlds.

This is a medium sized project with lots of room to grow. For the midterm, we hope to have the character creation section done, the realm randomization feature, as well as the base tracker that can be utilized for money, health, and experience. If we finish these features, we can continue on to more complicated things such as items and their utilities, spells, etc.
